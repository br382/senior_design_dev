Yes, it is just a single board android device,
with only a power input, antenna mount, USB jack,
power button, and display output.

And the device is simply water resistant by a simple rubber seal which neglets the ball joint.
The ball joint is secured by a C-clamp style ring to help the rubber O-ring inside hold the display at a specific angle.
The C-clamp ring also adds some joint reinforcement, but this joint and the display arm are the least water resistant parts of the assembly.
