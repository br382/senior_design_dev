Please see imgs under "Paintball HUD\design documents\software"
imgs reference map overlay class, pointer/icon marker class, and pointer/icon wrapper class.

GUI arangement ideas... (see imgs):
	Icon outline color picked via: height_color_list[int(k * ln(else_height - my_height))]
	Icon shaded by team/role (NFC-ID stored, changed by command and/or network alerts message passing), else use default.
	Icon inner circle outline shaded via: warning_color_list[ low_paint OR low_pressure ]
	Icon circle shaded by name/role (NFC-ID stored, changed by command and/or network alerts message passing), else use default.

	Map Overlay class (handle all map img overlay stuff quietly).
	Generic Point Shape Class (Define shapes, placement, colorings).
	Wrapper Point Class (convert raw sensor and usr pref data to inputs for shape plotting).
	
	Other GUI elements:
		what is on the gui?
		were is the map placed in the gui?
		are other dials/numbers/indicators placed on the gui?
		is there a PTT-radio indicator?
		will pop-up text notifications/alerts be supported?
		battery indicators?
